## Building Web App using PHP & MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript

In the previous lab sessions and lectures we have seen how to create web pages with **HTLM**, style elements with **CSS** and add some cool interactions with javascript.

Today we will see how we can use PHP on the server side to handle user data submitted from the frontend.

During the lecture, we have learnt PHP basics and during this lab we will build on that knowledge.

#### Getting Started with the sample App

Step 1. Clone or Fork this repository, the skeleton app is located in - `mywebapp`

The app has the structure as below:
    
- `css` - contains styles for the web pages
    
- `images` - contains images
    
- `js` - to hold our javascript codes

- `index.html`

- `login.html`

- `register.html`

- `database.sql` - contains the sql statement to create our MySQL database and table.
